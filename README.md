# Simple Plan Project Management APP

This is a React-based application designed for task tracking within a project. It enables users to create projects and tasks, as well as move tasks across various sections using drag-and-drop functionality. Each task includes key details such as its due date, description, a comments section, and the assigned members for streamlined collaboration.

## How it works

Sign up: Create an account to get started. Once you're signed in, you'll be directed to your dashboard.

Projects page: At first, you'll see the projects page. Here, you can create a new project or choose from an existing one. You can select a project either from this screen or from the navigation menu on the left.

Board component: Once you've selected a project, you'll be taken to the board component. This is where you can create task lists and tasks for those lists. You can move all the lists and tasks with drag and drop.

List management: You can change the name of a list or delete it by pressing on the list's name or the ellipsis by the list's name.

Task details: Each task can be clicked on to display a modal with the task's information. This includes the task's name, description, comments section, assigned members, watching, priority, and due date.

Top section of the board: You'll find a search bar, invite button, and a settings button at the top section of the board.

Search bar: Use the search bar to filter the tasks related to your search query.

Invite button: Use the invite button to share the project with other users. This can be done by entering their email addresses.

Settings button: The settings button is used to change the name or background of the project, as well as delete the project.

Navigation menu: In the navigation menu on the left, you'll also see a profile button. This can be used to give or change your avatar, change your name, change your email, or delete your account.

## Software used

I used React, React Hooks, Redux, and Typescript to create the frontend of my app, providing a fast and intuitive user interface.

To enable drag and drop functionality, I utilized the popular library, React Beautiful DND. I used Axios to handle all fetch requests, ensuring fast and reliable data retrieval.

For styling, I chose SCSS, a popular CSS preprocessor that allowed me to create beautiful and consistent styles throughout the app.

Finally, I built my server with Strapi API, providing robust and secure backend functionality to ensure smooth and seamless operation of the app.

## What I learned

Working on this project was a valuable learning experience that helped me to significantly enhance my React and TypeScript skills. Specifically, I gained a deeper understanding of component architecture, state management, and code organization, which allowed me to create a more efficient and maintainable codebase.

In addition, I also improved my proficiency in integrating APIs into a React App. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience working with APIs, making requests, handling responses, and displaying data. This knowledge will be invaluable as I continue to work on similar projects in the future.

Overall, this project allowed me to build on my existing skills and expand my knowledge in key areas, giving me a more well-rounded skillset as a developer. I feel much more confident in my ability to build high-quality React apps with TypeScript and integrate APIs in a seamless and efficient manner. I look forward to applying these skills to future projects and continuing to grow as a developer.
