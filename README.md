# Simple Plan Project Management App!
 
A React application used to track tasks within a project. The user has the ability to create projects, create tasks, and follow the progress being made. There are three pages that the user can interact with. There is the project hub, where the user can see all of the projects. There is the dashboard, where the user can see all of the details in regards to the chosen project. The main section is the tasks sections, where the user can create, edit, and delete tasks for the project. 
 
## How it works
 
The user can first create a project by clicking the + icon on the navigation. The user will then need to fill out all of the details for the project.

The user then can click on the project in the project hub or on the navigation. This will open up the dashboard with different details for the projects.

The user will then have the option to click on the tasks section, where they will be able to create, edit, and delete tasks. Once the task is finished, the user then can mark them as complete.

## Software Used
 
The app was built with React using functional components. It was also built with Typescript and Redux for state management. All of the styling was done with SCSS.  
 
## What I learned
 
I learned a lot about building a more responsive UI and how to add some basic animations. I am getting better at utilizing SCSS to use less code. I did this by using more shared placeholders for my app. 
 
I also got a lot better with using Typescript. I learned a lot about declaring types for Arrays and objects. I also got better at using interfaces to do this. 
 
I was able to use Redux in this app, which made everything a lot easier. It is definitely something I hope to use again soon. 
 
I got better with using JavaScript with the useState hook to create a CRUD application. I was able to utilize the spread operator more and get a better understanding of when to use the correct higher order function.
