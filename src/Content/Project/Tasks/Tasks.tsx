/*
come back to 
  How to find dates within the actual week 


      
    3) Create a modal 
        - connect same modal to edit bttn (do this later after creating elipsis options)

        show all (number)                    down arrow 
        show completed (number)              down arrow


        arrows turn up when active 


        make sure that the arrow origional filters out first three 

    4) Create options
        - show all tasks
            - only show top two or three by date closest
            - then show all when clicked 
            - show origional when clicked again (show less)

        - completed (wait until after next section)
            - show all tasks that have been completed 

    5) Have the elipsis bttn use modal to edit 
        - also allow for delete and finish 
        - need to update array to include finished tasks 

    6) Make the comment bttn open a modal 
      - need to use a diffirent modal for this 
        - copy one online 
          - add comment on top
          - previous comments on bottom 


          can click on card and all details pop up in a modal (save this for another time )





    Have 4 collumns 
      late 
      Next Week 
      Future 
      No dates 
    Have add button on top of each
    Show first three cards in array 
    Have show all button 
    Have show completed button 

    cards
      Name                   three dots(update, delete)
      Department             
      Date due               comments button
